# 🖥️ Welcome to my Github page! 💻
**I am a passionate software developer 💻 with a focus on developing secure and reliable proxies 🔒 for kids to use and bypass school firewalls 🚫. I have a wealth of experience in creating proxy projects, including MathAwesome 🔥, Arsenic 🎯, Aqua Proxy 💦, and Tsunami 🌊.

My technical expertise covers multiple programming languages 🤓, including HTML 🌐, CSS 🎨, JavaScript 💻, C# 💻, and Python 🐍. This wide range of skills 💡 has enabled me to create powerful and user-friendly proxies 💻 for students to use in the classroom 🏫.

In addition to my technical abilities 🤓, I also have a strong online presence 🌐. I previously owned multiple Discord servers 💬, such as the Cyx Network 📡, with over 150 members 👥. Although I no longer administrate these servers 🔧, I continue to maintain a TikTok profile 📹 with over 1000 followers 📈.

I am always eager to hear your suggestions and feedback 💬. Feel free to reach out to me through my Discord server at https://discord.gg/RvndfG4gmd 💬. Thank you for visiting my Github page 🖥️, and I look forward to working with you soon! 🔜**
